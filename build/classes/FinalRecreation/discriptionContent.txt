VOSB_00.jpg ::= Let us explore how Brendan made himself a hero by his persistence faith in God!!
VOSB_01.jpg ::= Heard of the Island of the Promise of the Saints, Brendan decided to take 14 monks with him, and sail to the land despite the fact that they would never know where they are heading.
VOSB_02.jpg ::= A few days after they start their voyage......
VOSB_03.jpg ::= Brendan and the 14 monks found out that they have run out of food!! All of then are hungry!!!
VOSB_04.jpg ::= In this kind of situation, if you are Brendan, what would you do?  Believe in yourself and do something else?  or just put your faith in God?
    VOSB_04_A.jpg ::= You might have thought of getting some fish from the sea, right? To be honest, I would do that, too! Who would go out on the sea without getting a fishing poll?
        VOSB_04_A_result.jpg ::= Brendan would be very disappointed of you chosen to rely on yourself, this is a journey to the God's land!!! God is testing on your faith on him!!!
    VOSB_04_B.jpg ::= You may think, this is a Christine story, they should have believe in their almighty God, Right?
        VOSB_04_B_result.jpg ::= Let me tell you, Brendan will be so proud of you when you made this decision. Because Brendan made this decision, too!!
VOSB_05.jpg ::= Brendan believed in God deeply, and he told the monks that they should also believe in their almighty God. All of them followed Brendan and chose to believe that God would get everything they want for them, and God did not disappoint them!! They arrived an island with fruit to eat and house to sleep!!! Brendan's decision leaded them out of the first difficulty!!
VOSB_06.jpg ::= After refreshing themselves, the unknown trip goes on...
VOSB_07.jpg ::= OH NO, Brendan and the 14 monks saw a sea monster coming toward then fiercely. It seemed like sea monsters are unavoidable feature for any adventurous stories!!
VOSB_08.jpg ::= Question time again!!! What would you do in this situation if you were Brendan?? Believe in yourself again? or let God lead everything for you?
    VOSB_08_A.jpg ::= You might be wondering how to panic now, right? It seem impossible to beat the monster with bare hand. Or maybe, you thinking about what funny last words you can say in this story?
        VOSB_08_A_result.jpg ::= Come on man, YOU WERE AN ABBOT!!! The HEAD of the MONKS!! Can't you just do what a monk should do? PRAY!!!
    VOSB_08_B.jpg ::= PRAY TO GOD! This is possibility also the only thing you can do, right?
        VOSB_08_B_result.jpg ::= Finally, the abbot did what he should lead the monks to do. PRAY!!
VOSB_09.jpg ::= By the leading of Brendan, Brendan's prayer summoned God's helper, another sea monster! Another sea monster blocked out the original sea monster's way, and Brendan's prayer saved the day again!! The monks must be thinking that why can Brendan be soooooo powerful!!!
VOSB_10.jpg ::= Saved by the God's helper, in the awe of the power of Brendan, they resumed their journey...
VOSB_11.jpg ::= During the trip, it seemed like they were hungry, again. 
VOSB_12.jpg ::= This is the second time facing this kind of issue, I think you know what should you do if your were Brendan THIS TIME.
    VOSB_12_A.jpg ::= You still insist go fishing would be a great idea for Brendan, didn't you?
        VOSB_12_A_result.jpg ::= Going through all these, don't you know pray is the only thing you should do??
    VOSB_12_B.jpg ::= hmm... It seemed like you kinda know Brendan well!
        VOSB_12_B_result.jpg ::= Been through so many tests, you finally proved yourself having the ability to lead a group of monks!!
VOSB_13.jpg ::= Lead by Brendan, all the monks believed that God would not abandon them because God never did that in this long lasting journey. Then God sent out birds to bring them grapes that were as big as an apple!! This made the monks even more relied on Brendan,and thought that following Brendan's words and praying could lead to miracle like this.
